			<h2>A History of Arsenal Football Club</h2>
			
			<p>Arsenal Football Club is an English football club, based in London. It is widely regarded as one of the most successful English football teams, playing in the Premier League and obtaining a wide range of cups, trophies and titles over the course of its more than one hundred years of performing.</p>
			<p>The origins of the club date back to 1886 where a group of workers in the Royal Arsenal, a weapons factory in London, banded together to purchase a football and matching outfits. Known as Royal Arsenal in their early years, the team earned a number of victories in matches and tournaments over the first decade of their existance. In 1893 they became the first English team to join the then mostly Scottish Football League, changing their name to Woolwich Arsenal in the same year. The team would play in the second division for the rest of the 19th century, earning a promotion to the first division in 1903.</p>
			<p>Despite this early success, the club entered a period of decline due to financial issues stemming from low attendance. They were forced to sell a number of their best players and began to drop severely in the tables, eventually being relegated back to the second division, which only exacerbated their financial troubles. In 1910 the club went into voluntary liquidation in order to avoid bankruptcy, eventually being purchased by a group of wealthy businessmen. One of these new owners was Sir Henry Norris, who at the time was also the chairmane of Fulham Football Club.</p>
			<p>Norris initially attempted to combine both Woolwich Arsenal and Fulham FC into a single club, but was prevented from doing so by the Football League. Instead, Norris decided to move the team to another location, in the hope that he could re-locate them to an area where they would see increased attendance. In 1913 the team moved from Woolwich to Highbury, renaming themselves The Arsenal. The move coincided with a significant improvement in performance from the team. By 1919 they had rejoined the first division and again renamed themselves - this time simply to Arsenal.</p>
			<p>In 1926 Arsenal reached the finals of the FA Cup for their first time, losing 1 - 0 to Cardiff City. In 1930 they again reached the finals, this time winning 2 - 0 against Huddersfield Town and earning the team their first major trophy. Further sucess followed over the next few years. Their matches repeatedly broke attendance records, and topped the first division after scoring 127 goals in the season of 1930-31. The following season they again reached the FA Cup, but were defeated by Newcastle United. Despite this they won their second league title the following year, and in the following season would go on to win hat-trick of league titles from 1932 to 1935, ending with a second FA Cup victory in '35.</p>
			<p>The years following the Second World War was a difficult period for Arsenal. Nine of their players had been killed in the war, and the construction of a new stadium in Highbury had left the club heavily in debt. In the season of 1946-47 they finished thirteenth place in the league, their worst performance in almost two decades. The team did manage some success, a major period of decline was coming. Arsenal celebrated their seventh league title in 1953, but this was to be the last trophy the club would win for the next seventeen years. Their fortunes waning, the club struggled to attract skilled new players, and match attendance declined drastically. In the 1965-66 football season Arsenal would finish fourteenth place, their worst ranking in thirty-six years, and would also record their lowest match attendance ever at the Highbury stadium</p>
			<p>Following the debacle of the '66 season, Arsenal underwent a period of re-organization. With the team unable to obtain players from outside talent was instead promoted from within, particularly from the Arsenal's youth team. The team once again began to move back towards success, reaching the League Cup finals in 1968 and 1969. In 1970 their trophy drough would finally come to an end, with the team defeating the Belgian team Anderlecht to win the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. The following year they became the second ever team to win both the FA Cup and the League Double. However, this string of victories would turn out not to be a full return to form, but merely a brief oasis of success in a desert of defeats. The following years would again see Arsenal suffer serious defeats, eventually ending up at seventeenth on the League tables in 1976, leading to the resignation of the club's manager. In the following years, Arsenal attempted to bounce back. Between 1978 and 1979 Arsenal reached the FA Cup final three years in a row, but only won one in 1979 against Manchester united. As the eighties began, the team's repeated failures began to take a serious toll, with a number of long-time sponsers ending relationships with the club and attendance again beginning to dwindle.
			<p>In 1986 a former Arsenal player, George Graham, was appointed the new club manager. Graham went to work attempting to solve what he percieved to be the main problems the club was facing. He sold most of the older players on the team, using the money to buy promising young players and promoted a number from the Arsenal youth team. He also imposed strict discipline on the team, particularly in how they acted on the pitch and in the dressing rooms. Graham's reforms resulted in a marked improvement in team performance, with Arsenal briefly managing to make it to the top of the league in '86, though they would later finish that season at fourth place. The following year the club would go on to again win the League Cup, marking the beginning of a new age of victories for Arsenal. </p>
			<p>The following years Arsenal would see a string of success, continuing on into the '90's. This period included the signing of Ian Wright for a record Â£2.5 Million, who would go on to be the all-time leading goalscorer for the team. From 1986 to 1992, the team averaged 66 League goals per season. In 1992 they were one of the founding members of the FA Premier League, although they would only place 10th on the inaugural season. That same year they again won both the FA Cup and the League Double. The following season they would win the UEFA Cup Winner's Cup beating previous cup-holders Parma. However, this was to be the last success the team had under the stewardship of George Graham, as he was fired from the club after it was discovered he had been taking bribes in exchange for acquiring players.</p>
			<p>Despite the controversy, Arsenal's success continued in the following years under its new management with the team winning a place in the UEFA Cup and the Championship League for the '96-'97 season. The following season the team would win another League Double. In 2002 Arsenal won their eight FA Cup, and the following season became the first team in twenty years to sucessfully defend the Cup, beating Southampton to retain the trophy. The 2003-04 season would see Arsenal break records after winning the Premier League completely unbeaten in a single match. Although they failed to retain the FA Cup again in 2004, they would still manage to win the League tables.</p>
			<p>Despite their continued success, the club would once again see itself enter a period of decline. Following the sale of team captain Patrick Vieira in 2005, the following season resulted in poor performance, with Arsenal being unable to take any trophies for the season. Their League performance again dropped, and they came close to missing out on a place in the Championship League for the first time since 1997, although they did manage to earn their place with some last-minute victories. </p>
			<p>In 2006 Arsenal moved from their stadium at Highbury to the newly-constructed Emirates Stadium. Although Highbury Stadium had become an iconic part of Arsenal's history its capacity was merely 38,500 people, and club officials realized that a larger stadium would result in higher income for the club. The move to Emirates Stadium coincided with a number of seasons of poor performance from the team. Between 2006 and 2013, Arsenal would fail to win a single trophy. However, this would be rectified when the team went on to win three FA Cups in four years, during the period of 2013 - 2017, seeing an impressive return to form.</p>
			<p>This leads us to where Arsenal is in the present day. As can be seen from above, Arsenal Football Club have a long and tumultous history filled with ups and downs. As one of the most sucessful English football teams, expectations are always high for Arsenal as they continue to compete and draw fans from around the world.
