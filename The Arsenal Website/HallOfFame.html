			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">The Frenchman had exquisite technique, searing pace and surprising strength. And like the typical schoolboy superstar, he did pretty much everything for his team. Henry was the captain, the talisman, the dead-ball expert, the penalty-taker and the assist-maker.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">Then there's the goals, a club record 228 of them to be precise. And what a portfolio Henry built up during his eight years as Arsenal. Thumping drives, delicate chips, jinking runs, audacious backheels, even the odd header - the Frenchman had myriad ways to find the net.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">Everyone has their own Henry highlights but here's just a few to whet the appetite: that flick-up and lob over Fabien Barthez, the slaloming run against Liverpool, the 60-yard surge against Spurs, that cheeky clip against Charlton, that beauty in the Bernabeu. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</p>

			 </div>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">And remember, Henry wasn't even a bonafide striker when he arrived at Highbury in the summer of 1999. Remember when he came off the bench for his debut against Leicester and threatened the North Bank regulars with his scattergun shooting? Surely Henry wasn't the natural replacement for Nicolas Anelka?</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">Arsène Wenger thought otherwise and, with the help of his eager French student, transformed Henry from erratic winger into striker extraordinaire. Henry took nine games to open his Arsenal account but a brace against Derby announced his arrival as a decent finisher. By the end of the season he was scoring at will and within a few years he was regarded as the best striker in the world. The North Bank could stop ducking and start celebrating.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">They had plenty to celebrate too as Henry's goals came hand in hand with trophies. There were disappointments at first - the Uefa Cup and the FA Cup slipped agonisingly through Arsenal's grasp at the turn of the century - but a Double in 2002 made amends. Henry's contribution was emphatic: 32 goals in all competitions.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">The Frenchman raised the bar even higher in the following two campaigns. Arsenal had to settle for the FA Cup in 2003 but 42 goals, 23 assists and both Player of the Year awards summed up just how influential Henry had become. He scooped both awards in 2004 as well and contributed 39 goals as Arsenal completed an unbeaten title season. Of all the 'Invincibles', Henry was surely the most indispensable.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">Patrick Vieira's surprise departure in the summer of 2005 took Henry onto an even higher plain - he was now Arsenal captain. He celebrated in style, eclipsing the club's scoring record with a brace at Sparta Prague in October of that year. Henry had learned so much about forward play from Ian Wright; now he was leaving the ultimate finisher in his wake.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">Two league titles, three FA Cups, four Golden Boots, five Player of the Year awards and that club record represented a major haul, but one thing was missing from Henry's CV. The Champions League had eluded him after an agonising defeat in the 2006 final but he made amends three years later when he was part of the Barcelona team which beat Manchester United.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">New York is where Henry ended his playing days. But he will always be an Arsenal man. In 2007 the fans voted for the Gunners' Greatest Moments and Henry was involved in five of the top 10. A year later, he eclipsed Bergkamp, Adams et al to win our Gunners' Greatest Player poll.</p>

			  <img src="Images/HallOfFame/Dennis.png" alt="Dennis-Bergkamp-photo" width="250" height="220">
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">You could fill two pages with a list of the goals that had their genius in his vision. And you could fill a dictionary with a list of superlatives used to describe his 11-year career with Arsenal. Dennis Bergkamp is quite simply a legend of the game.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">In the last two decades many one-time unknowns have left Highbury with a fearsome reputation and much-warranted acclaim. But, in a way, Dennis was an exception; he came, and left, with a world-class calibre.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">His arrival signalled a daring change in outlook from the men in charge at Arsenal. George Graham had been replaced by Bruce Rioch and ‘Boring, Boring Arsenal’ was to be replaced by something altogether more beautiful. Bergkamp was the catalyst.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">Of course Rioch’s Highbury sojourn came to an abrupt end and in September 1996 Arsène Wenger took the reins. Bergkamp needn’t have fretted over his place in the Frenchman’s plans, though, and Wenger later claimed Dennis’ presence in the ranks had been “a blessing, a gift when I arrived”.</p>

			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">And so it was that under the tutelage of Wenger, Bergkamp redefined football in England’s top division. His textbook technique, physical prowess and second-nature for picking out the killer pass made him the ultimate symbol of fantasy football. Indeed when Arsenal usurped Manchester United as the country’s best team in 1998, Bergkamp, too, succeeded Eric Cantona as the Premier League’s brightest beacon of European excellence.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">That Double season Arsenal’s No 10 was outstanding and his reward at the end of the campaign was both major Player of Year awards to go with his championship and FA Cup medals.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">But, strangely, Bergkamp had had a fitful beginning to life in London, failing to score in his first seven senior outings. Pressure was mounting not least from the tabloid media who had branded the Dutchman ‘Hartle-Fool’ after failing to score against the North East minnows in a League Cup tie. How wrong they were. Within a week the Iceman confounded his critics with a cool brace at home to Southampton. He never looked back.</p>

		    <h2 id="Tony">Tony Adams</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="articHall">
			  <img src="Images/HallOfFame/Tony.png" alt="Tony-Adams-photo" width="250" height="220">
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">Adams was the ultimate one-club man - a rarity in modern football - and a rock at the heart of Arsenal's defence. He thrived as the leader of the famous Back Four, developing an instinctive understanding with his centre-back partner Steve Bould and full-backs Lee Dixon and Nigel Winterburn. On an individual level, it's hard to think of a more committed, more gutsy and more inspirational footballer in Arsenal's history.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">It was clear that Adams was a bit special from the moment he signed for Arsenal as a schoolboy in 1980. Three years later he made his debut against Sunderland, four weeks after his 17th birthday. It was hardly an auspicious start - Adams was partly to blame for a 2-1 home defeat - but he soon found his feet at the top level.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">Adams' response was simple - he just pointed at his growing stack of medals. Eight weeks after his Old Trafford experience, the Arsenal captain led his team to the title on that famous night at Anfield. Two years later he had his hands on the same trophy and a domestic cup Double would follow in 1993. The taunts continued - a spell in prison from December 1990 fuelled the fire - but Adams always seemed to have the last laugh.</p>

			<a class="articInfo" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bfVQgVV1IM">Arsenal, 2014</a>	
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">He scored 48 goals during his Arsenal career and plenty of vital ones. The header which beat Tottenham at Wembley in 1993 will live long in the memory and another huge leap accounted for Torino in the Cup Winners' Cup quarter-final a year later. Adams was arguably at his peak during that European campaign. With David Seaman behind him and Bould alongside him, Adams and Arsenal were inpenetrable at times. Parma found that out in May 1994 as Adams lifted his first European trophy after a defensive masterclass.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">Whereas Graham had favoured a more direct style, Wenger encouraged Adams to be more expansive. He flourished, showing more poise in possession, initiating attacks from the back and even getting forward when he could. That approach manifested itself most emphatically on the final day of the 1997/98 season when Adams, put through by Bould (of all people), rifled a shot into the corner to put the top hat and tails on another title. Adams' celebration in front of an adoring North Bank remains one of the iconic moments in Arsenal's rich history. The FA Cup - and the Double - duly followed.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">Now in his 30s, Adams was increasingly hampered by injuries but, like so many Arsenal greats, he managed to go out on a high note. In Adams' case it was another Double, this time in 2002, clinched in style with a win at Old Trafford. Would the Adams of old have been part of that triumphant squad? Perhaps not, but the great man's final flourish was just reward for turning his life around six years earlier.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">A top-three finish in this poll is the least he deserves. Because when you think of Arsenal captains, you think of Tony Adams.</p>

			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">The Arsenal legend always found a way to find the net, whether it required a sumptuous 30-yard chip or a toe-poke from two yards. Wright's repertoire of goals made him one of the finest - and most explosive - strikers to grace the English game.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">And, of course, he was a showman. Wright was a force of nature on and off the pitch, assuming the mantle of practical joker in the dressing room and choreographing a string of theatrical goal celebrations. No wonder Arsenal fans loved 'Ian Wright Wright Wright'.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">The man himself was late on the scene in football terms - he signed professional terms for Crystal Palace in August 1985, just three months short of his 22nd birthday. It seems strange now but, when he moved to Arsenal in September 1991 for a club record £2.5 million, some questioned the wisdom of the transfer.</p>

			<a class="articInfo" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWezIrBCN5g">Arsenal, 2018</a>	
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">At the time, Arsenal were reigning champions, Alan Smith had won two Golden Boots in three seasons and Kevin Campbell had emerged from the youth ranks to bring muscle to a forward line which already boasted the flair and imagination of Anders Limpar and Paul Merson. Did Arsenal really need Wright?</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">George Graham knew better and was vindicated immediately. Wright scored on his Arsenal debut in the League Cup at Leicester, bagged a hat-trick on his league debut at Southampton and soon had the Highbury faithful eating out of his hand. It seemed Wright wrote his own scripts - on the final day of the season, he completed a hat-trick to snatch the Golden Boot from Tottenham's Gary Lineker and give the North Bank a rousing send-off before it was torn down that summer.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">A domestic cup Double in 1993 (Wright netted in the first game and the replay against Sheffield Wednesday) and a European Cup Winners' Cup triumph in 1994 brought Wright his first medals, although he missed the famous win against Parma after a misjudged sliding tackle in the semi-final second leg earned him a suspension. It was probably the best example of how Wright's volatile temper occasionally got him into trouble.</p>

			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">His name was Patrick Vieira and, together with his new manager, the midfielder went on to reshape the complexion of the club, embarking on a journey to two domestic Doubles and an historic unbeaten Premier League campaign.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">The rigours of England’s top flight were never going to be an issue for the 6ft 4in Vieira and his physical stature was as imposing as his powerhouse performances in the heart of Gunners midfield. Under the tutelage of his compatriot Wenger, Vieira blossomed into one of the world’s finest in his position, a remarkable athlete who could both win the ball and distribute it effectively.</p>

			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">Foreign players often plead for time to settle and, in the Wenger era alone, the likes of Thierry Henry, Marc Overmars, Robert Pires, Alex Hleb, Tomas Rosicky and Emmanuel Adebayor all needed the luxury of weeks or months before finding somewhere near top gear. Vieira broke the mould. Almost instantly the towering Frenchman stamped his authority on the Premier League and, alongside Emmanuel Petit, swept the Gunners to Double glory in his first full season.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">But what made Vieira special was that his graft came hand in hand with craft. The composure and quality of his passing meant that, as well as quelling the threat of the opposition, Patrick became a vital cog in Wenger's forward-thrusting machine. There were few more graceful sights in football than Vieira holding off an opponent in a congested midfield before flicking the ball over his head and racing away downfield to spark another Arsenal attack. He was simply a class act.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">Goals weren’t frequent but when they did arrive they were invariably spectacular or crucial. There are the long-range net-busters against Newcastle and Manchester United which showcased Vieira’s power, but then the dinked finish to conclude a sweeping move against Liverpool which illustrated an astute football mind.</p>

			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">Donning 'Rocky's' No 7 shirt that day was a Frenchman who had flattered to deceive in his opening few months as a Gunner. By full-time, though, and with the old enemy once again disposed of, the fans rejoiced in the ‘arrival’ of Robert Pires.The former Metz man showed guts, passion and creativity worthy of Rocastle, duly breaking the deadlock midway through the second half. He never looked back.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">The fans had been hurt by Marc Overmars’ departure the previous summer but, thanks to another shrewd bit of transfer dealing from Arsène Wenger, the Dutchman's absence was rarely felt. Pires was a revelation, boasting a playmaker’s vision and a striker’s instinct in equal measure. His unusual running style was deceptive as Pires' fleet-of-foot was vital in the Arsenal machine of the early 2000s.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">Pires arrived with some pedigree - he had been part of the all-conquering French team of 1998 and 2000 - but, by his own admission, he struggled early on. Fears that he would falter under the physical demands of the Premier League seemed merited. But familiarity brought about a potency in Pires, and the Frenchman began to thrive.</p>

			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">In his second season Robert was a fearsome proposition for defences across Europe. A sublime lob over Peter Schmeichel at Villa Park stands out, but there were other special efforts against Blackburn and Tottenham, too.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">However his campaign was to end prematurely when Arsenal hosted Newcastle in an FA Cup sixth-round replay in March. By now Pires was rampant, scoring the first and providing the second in a 3-0 win, before suffering serious cruciate knee ligament damage in front of the Clock End. It would keep him out until November.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">His season had shuddered to a halt but Pires had done enough to scoop the Football Writers' Footballer of the Year award for his role in Arsenal’s Double triumph. On the final day of the campaign, Pires’ team-mates bowed down in front of him as he lifted the Premier League trophy. It summed up the regard in which Pires was held. That feeling was echoed in France. "It's Roberto, what can I say... we miss hi,." explained right-back Lilian Thuram on his countryman’s absence from that summer’s World Cup.</p>

			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">That was George Graham's response to the show of support for Lukic when Arsenal were linked with a highly-rated stopper from Queen's Park Rangers in the spring of 1990. "We all agree... Lukic is better than Seaman!" rang around Highbury in the months that preceded Graham's swoop, eventually completed that summer. But the Arsenal boss was emphatically proved right.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">At the time the fee of £1.3 million, a British record for a goalkeeper, was thought excessive by some. In hindsight, it's up there with Ian Wright, Steve Bould, Lee Dixon and Nigel Winterburn as the best money Graham - or any Arsenal manager - has ever spent.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">Seaman's sustained excellence won over the fans in no time and he became the cornerstone of an Arsenal back five which kept 23 clean sheets and conceded just 18 goals en route to the 1990/91 league title. Seaman's qualities were manifold - he had sharp reflexes, excellent positional sense, great judgement from crosses and bags of courage.</p>

			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">Those attributes were all on show in Seaman's first campaign as the Arsenal keeper produced matchwinning performances at Tottenham and Liverpool en route to the title. One full-length fingertip save from Gary Owers in the driving rain at Sunderland stands out as a moment which encapsulated Seaman's brilliance. He was a spectator for much of that match but, as he proved time and again, Seaman was always alert when danger needed averting.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">The title evaded Arsenal for seven years but Seaman remained to the fore as Graham's side became cup kings at home and in Europe. By now Wright was the major weapon in attack and the well-worn chant of 'One-Nil to the Arsenal' was born as the livewire striker nicked a goal while Seaman - plus the famous Back Four - took care of the clean sheet.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">The European Cup Winners' Cup probably saw Seaman's finest individual moments. Hampered by a broken rib, the Yorkshireman had pain-killing injections before keeping out a stellar cast of Zola, Brolin and Asprilla in the 1994 backs-to-the-wall win over Parma. The following season he pulled off three superb saves in a semi-final penalty shoot-out against Sampdoria and, although Nayim's freakish winner spoiled the final, Seaman's stock was sky high.</p>

			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">Brady's ability was evident from the moment he joined Arsenal on schoolboy forms in 1970. He turned professional on his 17th birthday in 1973 and Bertie Mee wasted no time in blooding Highbury's most talented teenager. In October of that year, Brady came off the bench to replace Jeff Blockley and make his debut against Birmingham City.</p>

			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">In those early days Brady learned valuable lessons from his first midfield partner, the World Cup winner Alan Ball. And when Ball left - having joined forces with Brady to guide Arsenal away from relegation trouble - Brady assumed the mantle of midfield master. And how.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">Brady scaled new heights following the appointment of Terry Neill as manager and the return of Don Howe as coach. And as the likes of Malcolm Macdonald and Frank Stapleton gorged on chances conjured up by Brady, Arsenal emerged from their mid-Seventies slump to reach three successive FA Cup finals between 1978 and 1980.</p>
			  <p title="https://www.arsenal.com/">The second of those prompted one of Brady's finest performance in an Arsenal shirt. The Irishman tore Manchester United to ribbons at Wembley, setting up first-half goals for Brian Talbot and Frank Stapleton. Then, after United hauled themselves level with two late goals, Brady dug deep to launch one final surge into opposition territory. His pass to Graham Rix forced the left winger to accelerate and cross. Alan Sunderland was on the end of it and the rest is history.</p>
