				<h2>Oguz Sarac - 2988989</h2>

				<p>Greetings! My name is Oguz Sarac. I am from Turkey and I am 18 years old. This is my first year at Griffith College and also Dublin, Ireland. I am interested in computer science, video games, sport, and photography. Computers first appeared in my life when I was eight. First game I had was 'Counter-Strike 1.6' and from my perspective, that was the best game in my whole life. Now, I have a better and faster computer but I am still playing 'Counter-Strike 1.6'. When I came to the College first time, I was not able to programming or creating a website. Now, I have my own website and I am proud of myself.</p>
				<p>My favorite DJ is a Deadmau5. I think he is the best DJ in the World. In each new album of Deadmau5, I am getting excited more than the old one because every album he performs different beats and drops. I went to the Deadmau5 concert once, the concert was in Istanbul and it was more crowded than I expected.</p>
				<p>I am interesting in Bodybuilding. I am doing that sport since 2016. Also, I am good at Chess I won gold medal two times when I was in high-school.I have always dreamt about of studying abroad, learning the course in different language. I started researching where I could go to fulfill my target. After that, I came across Griffith College. Amazing College in a lovely city. I believe that Griffith College is the option for me to have a solid education and a great friendship and time while studying.</p>

				<h2>Andrew Roche - 2967864</h2>

				<p>My name is Andrew Roche, I am a 28 year-old Computing Science student at Griffith College. I have had an interest in computers and computing technology ever since I was young, when my family first got a computer - an old Dell desktop computer which sat on the kitchen table for several years. As a kid I was always curious about how it worked, but mostly saw it just as something to play games on.</p>
				<p>After finishing secondary school, I enrolled at Dublin City University to begin working on a degree in Biotechnology, as it was a field that I had grown to become quite interested in. However, by the time the first year had finished and I had gotten a look first-hand at what such a career entailed, I decided that this was no longer a field I wanted to work in and made the decision to leave the course and re-assess what I wanted to do in life.</p>
				<p>Over the following years I found myself taking up jobs in the tech industry. My first job was as a tech-support agent for Microsoft, providing support for the Xbox 360 and the Windows Phone. After a a couple of years there I decided that I'd had enough of unhappy people complaining down a phone at me, and left. The following year or so I spent travelling around Europe, visiting a number of countries I had long had an interest in seeing such as France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Turkey and more. </p>
				<p>After returning from my travels, I settled down and took up work with Sky, working again in the support sector providing support for their broadband customers. It wasn't long before I again grew tired of constant customer complaints and began thinking about a sizable change in careers. I had long had an interest in computers, in particular programming, but had never really acted upon that interest myself. With a growing desire for something new, I decided to leave my job at Sky and enroll in a Computing Science course, in the hope of finding a new career in a field more to my interests.</p>
